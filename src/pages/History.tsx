                    St. Barbara is the patron saint of artillerymen and those who face danger from thunderstorms, fire, and explosions. According to legend, she was the beautiful daughter of Dioscorus, a pagan nobleman who kept her locked in a tower to preserve her from the outside world.

                    Mary Hays McCauly, better known as "Molly Pitcher," became a legendary figure during the American Revolutionary War when she took her wounded husband's place at a cannon during the Battle of Monmouth on June 28, 1778.

                    Her courage under fire earned her recognition from General Washington himself, who issued her a warrant as a noncommissioned officer. Her story represents the spirit and dedication that defines the artillery tradition.
